### CPSC 120

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1 was a favorite because it used loops. During this time looops were something that was difficult to me and after this lab, I felt more confident than ever. Not only that, but this lab allowed us to create a program for Judge Scores. 
* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I was curious about how the
    game Blackjack works. While I don't gamble, beingI able to write functions for the first time
    that calculate the correct value of a Blackjack hand no matter how many
    Aces were dealt was fun. I'd like to try to do the same with other games. 
* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 2 was a fun one because it gave us a measurment tool. Going to Feet from inches or visevera isn't difficult but because of the program we made, I can find the exact number. This program is something that can easily be used in the real world and because of this lab, I now have it.
